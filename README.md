# Red Cross DFW  Data Analysis & Donor Prediction Project
## Overview:
This repository contains the code and documentation for my Machine Learning and Data Analysis project on the Red Cross Donor dataset. The Red Cross donor data was collected by the organization itself for the DFW area in the United States. 
The goal of this project is to 1)analyze various aspects of the donors using Python and Pandas, providing insights into their demographics, donor trends, and other key metrics and 2) Predict the donor indicatior(likelihood of a costituent donating to the organization).

## Project Objectives:
- Clean and explore the donor dataset to understand its structure and characteristics.
- Analyze trends and patterns within the donor demographics and donation trends.
- Investigate the relationship between key variables and donation likelihood.
- Provide visualizations and summary statistics, as well as prescriptive recommendations.
- Ultimately guide the client to allocate their limited resources more efficiently by contacting the most positive prospectsthe organization.

## Key Features:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values, redundant values, and outliers.
- Exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution and relationships of variables and donors.
- Visualization of key insights using Tableau.
- Documentation of analysis steps, insights, and recommendations.

## Dependencies:
- Google Colab Notebook
- Pandas
- Pycaret
- Tableau
